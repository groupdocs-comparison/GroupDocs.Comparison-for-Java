Can identify styling and formatting changes - like bold, italic, underlines, strike-troughs, font types, etc.

## Apply/Reject changes between documents

Every particular difference between compared document can be applied or rejected and the exported to a final document.

## Document information extraction

This may be quite useful for generating previews of compared documents.
